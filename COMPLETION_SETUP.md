## Completions

Once loaded hit [TAB] after typing the `geeny` keyword to get partial commands
completed or suggestions for sub-commands and options. Keep hitting [TAB] to get a
cursor driven menu over relevant options.

This is legacy documentation on how to setup autocompletion with the Geeny CLI.

### bash

The bash completions are dynamically generated by re-running the cli with a special flag.

Ensure you have this directory: `/etc/bash_completion.d`
If you don't, run `mkdir /etc/bash_completion.d`

To install:

`cp ./completion/geeny_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d`

Then add this to your `~/.bashrc` file

```
source /etc/bash_completion.d/geeny_bash_completion
```

Save changes and reload with `source ~/.bashrc`

### zsh (simple)

The zsh completions are essentially the bash completions

Ensure you have this directory: `/etc/bash_completion.d`
If you don't, run `mkdir /etc/bash_completion.d`

To install:

`cp ./completion/geeny_zsh_completion /etc/bash_completion.d`
`cp ./completion/geeny_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d`

Then add this to your `~/.bashrc` file

```
source /etc/bash_completion.d/geeny_zsh_completion
```

Save changes and reload with `source ~/.bashrc`

### zsh (detailed)

These are updated by hand, so might sometimes be out of date.

To install, place the file `./completion/geeny_zsh_detailed_completion` in one of the folders listed in your `fpath` variable. Assuming you are using OhMyZsh `fpath` is usually set in `~/.oh_my_zsh/.oh-my-zsh.sh`. Else you can view it with `echo $fpath`.

When you've copied the file, rename it to `_geeny`.

Add `autoload -U compaudit compinit` to your `~/.zshrc` to load all completions each time you open the terminal. If your `fpath` is set in your `~/.zshrc`, make sure this line is added afterwards.

If there are still problems, try running `rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit` and re-opening the shell.
